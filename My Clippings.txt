revolution and freedom from colonial oppression has not eliminated the importance of race and skin color in everyday life in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and other Latin American countries.10 Wealth and power are still mostly concentrated among people of primarily European descent, and poverty is still concentrated in communities that are non-European – or as one researcher puts it, “the browner the neighborhood, the poorer it is.”11

By extension, it is also the case that politics generally refers to white politics. But, because white is the default, people do not think of white as an identity – therefore, to many white people, only other politics are identity politics

The glaring racism and misogyny does not mean that we should “cancel” classic political theory. However, it does mean that we cannot treat the insights derived from the classics as universal truths. They may be truths for some of us, but they are certainly not truths for all of us

Being part of an ideological group defnes a person as a member (us) and everyone else as non-members (them). This us–them dynamic, where a person believes their group to be superior to the other group, contributes to the increase in people who have built their ideological commitment into their social identity

SUMMARY • The basic defnition of politics is who gets what, when, how. • The foundations of politics are the following: o Political theory, which gives us ways to think about what qualifes as the “good life” o Political ideology, which is a set of values/beliefs that structure a person’s political worldview o Political behavior, which is how people act in the political realm

Many of the foundational political theory texts are riddled with racism, sexism, classism, and other biases. o Critical theory, largely developed by scholars from marginalized groups, pushes back against the canon, exposing diﬀerent forms of structural injustice and proposing remedies to those injustices. Critical race theory and feminism are two examples of critical theory. • Political ideology is a controversial concept and many people view it negatively. However, people frequently adopt ideological outlooks that structure their view of how the world works. It is increasingly common for people to view their political worldview as part of their identity, just as people view ethnicity or religion as part of their identity. o The more strongly people identify with an ideology, the more likely they are to be actively hostile to people with other ideological viewpoints, a problem known as aﬀective polarization. • Although presented separately, there is considerable overlap between political theory and ideology. The two cannot be as easily separated either in practice or in theory. • Civil society, the organizations outside the control of government, is essential to a functioning democracy. Among the many types of organizations are interest groups, which work inside the formal institutions of government in their quest to affect public policy, and social movements, which are less-formal groups that have come together around a particular issue and work outside the formal institutions of government (e.g., through protest). • Political parties provide the primary link between citizens and the state. Parties are involved in every stage of the political process, from candidate recruitment to policy outcomes. • While even some authoritarian regimes have elections (e.g., North Korea), it is free and fair elections that are a hallmark of democratic governance. Voter turnout is falling in the oldest democracies; we cannot be sure if this is a sign that people are satisfed with their governments or if they are not. • Democratic backsliding happens when governments in democratic states undermine or eliminate institutions and rules that sustain democracy. Citizens have shown that when the authoritarian-leaning leader comes from “their side” of the political divide, they are more likely to ignore or forgive actions that undermine democracy. Thus, aﬀective polarization helps to enable democratic backsliding. o Knowing the tactics enables you to fght against eﬀorts to undermine democracy

SUMMARY This chapter explored how the intersection of race, gender, sexuality, and other markers of power inform political theorists’ understandings of who qualifes for the good life as well as the state’s part in facilitating this life. With this two-pronged goal in mind, the frst section of the chapter detailed the logic that undergirds intersectional theorizing. • We began by examining two distinct streams of intersectional thought – both of which reﬂect and expand upon the defnition of intersectionality provided in the Introduction to this book. • We then turned our attention to how political theorists use these streams of intersectional theorizing to determine which social groups qualify for a good life. Our focus here was on pioneering intersectional theorists like Anna Julia Cooper. It was also on John Locke and other thinkers whose work is not traditionally associated with an intersectional framework, but who clearly exhibit intersectional thinking – albeit for political and economic goals that intersectionality’s Black feminist pioneers would not sanction. • We also examined Black women’s and white women’s eﬀorts to gain voting rights during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Our examination revealed that, as is the case with political theorists, political activists also embrace intersectionality in ways that seek to expand as well as constrain who qualifes for the good life. The rest of the chapter highlighted another important reality – that the logic of intersectionality shapes political theorists’ varied understandings of how much of a role the state should play in facilitating the good life. • The fnal section of this chapter foregrounded two of these theorists, John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx, whose historical views on the relationship between

the role of the state, on the one hand, and achieving the good life, on the other, have inﬂuenced the social, economic, and political life of many groups in United States, Canada, and beyond. • At the end of the chapter we turned, once again, to a concrete case study. Our focus this time was on the contemporary gay rights movement and on how activists within the movement draw on an intersectional framework when considering the state’s responsibility to facilitate the good life. CONCLUDING QUESTIONS 1 How do you defne the good life? How is your defnition similar to and diﬀerent from Marin Luther King, Jr.’s? 2 Carrie Chapman Catt’s defnition of the good life was inﬂuenced by her status as a white, middle-class woman. How is your defnition of the good life informed by your own position at the intersection of race, class, gender, and other markers of power? 3 John Stuart Mill argued that the disadvantages of having the state play a central role in facilitating the good life outweigh the advantages. Is his argument correct? Why or why not? 4 Claudia Jones used an intersectional framework to make the case that the state is key to fostering the good life. What are the most and the least persuasive aspects of how Jones embraced the logic of intersectionality
